## Project Structure
- Volunteer Client Application `/client`
- Admin Application `/client-admin`
- Server Application `/server`
- Data Model Representing System API `./model`
- OpenShift Deployment `./.openshift`

## Getting Started
* [Running Apps and Server](Running-Apps-and-Server)
* [Technical Details](Technical-Details)
* [Running Clients as Mobile Applications](Running-Clients-as-Mobile-Applications)
* [Using MQTT for GraphQL subscriptions](Using-MQTT-for-GraphQL-Subscriptions)
* [Development](Development) 

**Requirements:**
- [Node.js 12.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or later version
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Access to a running OpenShift instance (_Optional_)

### Running Apps and Server

1. Install yarn and project dependencies
```shell
npm install -g yarn
yarn
```
2. Build client admin and client 
```shell
yarn
yarn prepare:all
```
3. Start the server
```shell
cd ./server
docker-compose up -d
## Wait at least minute for containers to start
yarn keycloak:init
yarn start
```
4. Links to applications should be printed in the console.
```shell
    ðŸŽ® Ionic PWA application available at http://localhost:4000
    ðŸŽ® Admin PWA application available at http://localhost:4000/admin
```
  By default, the two users that can log into the application are created:
  - username: `developer`; password: `developer`
  - username: `admin`; password: `admin`
   Volunteers can register to the application in the login screen. 


### Technical Details

#### Keycloak Integration

Follow these instructions to set up Keycloak for Authentication/Authorization.

1. Configure the Keycloak Server

    ```shell
    cd ./server
    yarn keycloak:init
    ```
   This command creates the necessary resources in Keycloak and prints instructions you must follow to enable the integration.

2. Follow the printed instructions and copy the JSON configurations to the appropriate locations.
   The Starter app and server will read these configurations and the integration will be enabled when they are started.

Volunteer accounts for logging to voulnteer app that can be used:

```log
hzaub	
kudi
msash
tgers
tmaure
ukon
wtrocki
```

Admin application user:

`ovp-admin`

The password is the same as the username.


> NOTE: If you'd like to use demo data users and have them automatically imported in keycloak, run the keycloak init script as below: 
```shell
USE_DEMO_DATA=false yarn keycloak:init
``` 

This command will create the following usernames:

```log
hzaub	
kudi
msash
tgers
tmaure
ukon
wtrocki
```

The password is the same as the username.

You can use these user names to login into the volunteer client application. 

### Running Clients as Mobile Applications

#### For IOS:
```
cd ./client
yarn cap add ios
yarn run:ios
```

#### For Android:
```
cd ./client
yarn cap add android
yarn run:android
```

When running locally you will need to also enable HTTP traffic. 
For example, for Android add `android:usesCleartextTraffic#"true"` to AndroidManifest.xml

The project should start in IDE and can be launched as any other native application.

## Using MQTT for GraphQL Subscriptions

By default, the platform uses an in memory subscription mechanism that is not recommended for production. For OpenShift deployment, the AMQ MQTT protocol is used. On your local machine, this can be configured using the following steps:

1. Go to server/scripts ./mqtt
2. Execute docker-compose
3. Set the MQTT_HOST variable in the `.env` file. 
   `MQTT_HOST#127.0.0.1`

### Running On OpenShift

Please check out the [.openshift](platform/.openshift/README.md) folder for more information.

## Development 

The Starter template is based on the [Graphback](https://graphback.dev) open source project. Please follow the Graphback [Getting Started Guide](https://graphback.dev/docs/intro/datamodel) to learn how to modify the Open Volunteer Platform.

### Executing Graphback source generator

The  following command generates client side queries and mutations for the client side:

```sh
yarn generate:all
```
