== History

Repository is based on https://github.com/aerogear/datasync-starter project that our team build over the years.
All development on the repository started around March 2020 after we started to see problems with the isolation and looked for 
more comprehensive and flexible solutions to resolve this issues. Instead of building an App - we decided to reach out to organizations and 
local communities to see what problems they facing. In most of the cases those were really specific to the community and almost always
required certain level of customization on top of the very well known model of Workforce Management systems. 
This is why OpenVolunteerPlatform was started and going to be continously evolving to help organizations to fight crisises like COVID19.
